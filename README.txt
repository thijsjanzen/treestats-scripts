### README ####

Please find here for every plot in the manuscript that is based on data,
relevant code to reproduce the plot. Every folder is named after the respective
figure, and contains a file called 'plot.R', and related files unique for that
plot. Shared datasets can be found in the 'datasets' folder, which includes
also simulation results (simulation code can be found in the relevant figure
folders). In the datasets folder there is also a file called 'datelife.R', which
was used to collect overarching phylogenetic information for all species in the
dataset.
The folder 'R packages' contains tar ball installation packages for the following R packages:
- treestats - the package used for all calculations
- bissesim  - unpublished package used for fast simulation of the BiSSE model
- physim    - unpublished package used for fast simulation of the DDD and PBD model

To execute the code for figure 5, please place the file trees.rds, which can be downloaded separately if available.
